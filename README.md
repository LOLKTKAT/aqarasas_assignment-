## Objective
StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

## Responsibilities

The system has 4 core responsibilities:

1.  **Data**
    
    -   Properties list
        
    -   Selected property
        
    -   Filters / map bounds
        
2.  **Map Engine**
    
    -   Rendering map
        
    -   Markers
        
    -   Camera movement (flyTo, zoom)
        
3.  **UI**
    
    -   Sidebar list
        
    -   Property card
        
    -   Popups
        
4.  **Orchestration**
    
    -   Sync Control Panal ↔ map
        
    -   Handle user interactions

## My Development Approach
I will follow a feature-based branching strategy where **map**, **sidebar**, and **control panal** are developed independently and integrated via shared state.
